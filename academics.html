	<p>My 2022-2023 school year was full of many academic ups and downs. I found myself excelling in my first semester, ending with all As, and a new love for some subjects. I never expected to enjoy Anatomy as much as I do. However, after getting sick at the beginning of the second semester, and losing overall motivation due to getting into college, my grades started to slip a little. By now, I have gotten most of my grades up and am proud of where I am academically..</p>
